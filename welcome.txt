Yo!  Welcome to your new HTML5 Boilerplate MVC App.

** MotherEffin TODO:

1.  Modify your layout and default css (site.css)
2.  Update the humans.txt file to let other humans know about you.
3.  Set up google analytics and uncomment the google analytics tracking in _Layout.cshtml.
4.  Remove this file so no one can see your super secret todo list.
5.  Build in Release mode before deployment so your CSS and JS references are minified by SquishIt.

** Notes About CSS and JS Combination and Minification

I've gotten rid of the hacky AjaxMin tasks because they didn't work with AppHarbor.
We now use SquishIt to combine and minify CSS and JS files. See the _Layout.cshtml
in Views/Shared for more details.  
When running in Debug the files are linked individually, but when in Release mode 
they are combined and minified.
